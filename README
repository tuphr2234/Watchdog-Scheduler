Watchdog

In software systems, it's essential to ensure that critical processes can recover from failures and continue running. The Watchdog library allows you to achieve this by creating processes that are "immortal" and can be automatically restarted in the event of a failure.

The Watchdog library is designed to help you create processes that are resilient and can recover from failures. It provides two key functions: MakeMeImmortal and DoNotResuscitate, which enable you to control the behavior of a process and its watchdog mechanism.

This Watchdog uses another module, Scheduler, that is also included in this repository.
